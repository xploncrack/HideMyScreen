# HideMyScreen
A small C# script I made that switches whatever process you're on by the click of a key.

# How to use:
1. Download source code and compile
2. Run exe and wait a couple seconds for console to disapear.
3. Press {ESCAPE} key whenever you need to hide a process

# Important
**Make sure process is in foreground (active)**
**The process will close so you may loose data if your working on something**
